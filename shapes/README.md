# Shapes

## Structure of the Shapes contained here.

This directory contains the following sub-directories, each containing ShEx
Shapes and an `/example` folder showing demonstration Turtle files conforming
to the relevant Shapes. The Turtle files are also used to demonstrate how
instances of Pod Resources are expected to be interlinked

## Indexes

We use the term 'index' throughout our modelling with two very different
interpretations:

 - Index in the sense of a single Pod resource containing a collection of
   entities. E.g., a single Person-Index resource might contain a list of 50
   Person instances, where each instance contains a reference (or link) to the
   actual Person resource elsewhere in my Pod, but may also contain a copy of
   the Person's name and profile image perhaps, directly in the index too.
 - Index in the sense of a '_default resource to look for when navigating to a
   Container_'. In much the same way as browsers will automatically look for a
   resource named 'index.html' when browsing to a website, our modelling can
   store resources named 'index.ttl' in the root of containers, which our
   applications can then expect to contain app-specific information.

### Indexes as 'efficient containers for a collection of entities'

We chose not to model these collections using either native RDF lists (e.g.,
`rdf:Seq`), nor LDP containers, nor some existing list or set vocabulary (e.g.,
such as Schema.org's [ItemList](https://schema.org/ItemList), or the Ordered
List Ontology ([OLO](http://smiy.sourceforge.net/olo/spec/orderedlistontology.html))).
The reasons for this were:
 - This was originally modelled around limitations of the first Solid server
   (NSS).
 - Efficiency reasons, i.e.,  where we wish to retrieve a collection of entities
   in a single HTTP resource request (e.g., a list of people, perhaps with just
   their first name and date-of-birth values), as opposed to needing to make
   multiple HTTP requests, one for each Person resource in our list.


#### Example of index use

For example, a single AddressBook resource may reference two indexes, one for
the collection of email addresses in that AddressBook (i.e., using the
predicate `vcard:nameEmailIndex`), and one for the collection of groups in that
AddressBook (i.e., using the predicate `vcard:groupIndex`).


## Bookmarks

We've decided to keep the structure of bookmarks simple, only storing
`dcterms:created`, `dcterms:title`, and `bookmark:recalls`. Note that some Solid
bookmarking apps also use `foaf:maker`, but we didn't think it necessary in the
context of the PodBrowser, so we've chosen to make it optional.

We've also decided to omit the use of an index using `dcterms:references`, as
this would require us to keep the index up-to-date manually, and we think it's
better to find the bookmarks using the `bookmark:Bookmark` class. 

At some point we might need to group bookmarks, but at this point we've chosen
to keep it simple and simply implement bookmarks as a set of bookmarks that are
stored in one file.

## Contacts

Because there are some differences between the ShEx shapes we've described and
previous work on SHACL shapes, we wanted to explain the differences between
those shapes. Once these differences have all been resolved, we might remove
this README altogether.

### Address Book: Differences between ShEx and SHACL

The following is how the SHACL shape in
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/contacts-pane/master/shapes/contacts-shapes.ttl`
differs from the ShEx shape in `contacts/address-book.shex`.

- vcard:AddressBook
  - vcard:fn (instead of dc:title)
    - There can be one or more instances.
  - vcard:nameEmailIndex
    - There can be one or more instances.
    - There is no specific datatype set.
  - vcard:groupIndex
    - Uses terms (e.g., sh:count, sh:FollowMe) that aren't formalized.
    
### Group Index: Differences between ShEx and SHACL

The following is how the SHACL shape in
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/contacts-pane/master/shapes/contacts-shapes.ttl`
differs from the ShEx shape in `contacts/group-index.shex`.

- vcard:AddressBook
  - vcard:fn
    - Different cardinality ({1,m} vs {1,1}).
  - vcard:includesGroup
    - We used an inverse triple constraint instead (putting this term under
      vcard:Group shape instead).

### Group: Differences between ShEx and SHACL

The following is how the SHACL shape in
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/contacts-pane/master/shapes/contacts-shapes.ttl`
differs from the ShEx shape in `contacts/group.shex`.

- vcard:AddressBook
  - vcard:includesGroup
    - Using informal terms (sh:count, sh:FollowMe).
- vcard:Group
  - vcard:fn cardinality difference (one or more instead of just one).
  - vcard:member (informal term) instead of vcard:hasMember.
    
### People Index: Differences between ShEx and SHACL

The following is how the SHACL shape in
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/contacts-pane/master/shapes/contacts-shapes.ttl`
differs from the ShEx shape in `contacts/person-index.shex`.

- vcard:Individual
  - vcard:inAddressBook
    - uses informal term sh:BackwardLink.
    - minimum and maximum one instance of IRI (i.e., can only be referenced from
      one address book).

### Person: Differences between ShEx and SHACL

The following is how the SHACL shape in
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/contacts-pane/master/shapes/contacts-shapes.ttl`
differs from the ShEx shape in `contacts/person.shex`.

- vcard:Individual
  - is closed.
  - using informal term sh:count.
  - vcard:fn
    - uses sh:pattern ".* .*".
  - vcard:hasUID
    - different cardinality ({1, 1} vs {0, 1}).
    - uses sh:pattern "^urn:uuid:".
  - vcard:hasName
    - has a shape of its own (:NameShape):
      - vcard:family-name
      - vcard:given-name
      - vcard:additional-name
      - vcard:honorific-prefix
      - vcard:honorific-suffix
    - we used string, but added a comment.
  - vcard:hasImage
    - don't specify type dc:Image.
  - vcard:hasRelated
    - don't specify node or sub-shape (we specified a shape for
      vcard:RelatedType in ShEx).
  - vcard:url
    - has a shape of its own (:WebPageShape):
      - uses vcard:value (vs rdf:value).
      - uses sh:pattern "^https?:".
      - uses informal term sh:count.
    - we specified type rdf:Resource in the ShEx shape.
  - vcard:hasAddress
    - don't specify node or sub-shape (vcard:Address).
  - vcard:anniversary
    - we used vcard:bday in the ShEx shape.
  - vcard:hasEmail
    - uses sh:pattern "^mailto:" (vs /^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/ in ShEx).
    - uses vcard:value (vs rdf:value).
    - uses informal term sh:count.
    - different cardinality (ShEx is *).
  - vcard:hasTelephone
    - uses sh:pattern "^tel:" (vs /^\+?[0-9]+[0-9-]*[0-9]$/ in ShEx).
    - uses vcard:value (vs rdf:value).
    - uses informal term sh:count.
    - different cardinality (ShEx is *).
