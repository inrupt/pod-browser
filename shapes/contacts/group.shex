# This shape describes some of the information we store when adding a group to
# an address book. The resource it is used for is to describe the group itself
# (meaning the resource should only contain one group). We use the id "#this"
# to refer to the subject of the group.

# This model is originally developed as part of the
# SolidOS/Data Browser project, and we strive to keep it interoperable with
# their work. Some custom terms have been introduced to vocabularies we think
# they could belong to (e.g. vcard:includesGroup). We'll make a note of the
# custom term when used.

vcard:Group {
  vcard:fn xsd:string {1} ;
  vcard:note xsd:string ? ;
  vcard:hasMember vcard:Individual * OR vcard:Organization * ;
  # vcard:includesGroup is a custom term
  # vcard:AddressBook is a custom class
  ^vcard:includesGroup vcard:AddressBook
}
